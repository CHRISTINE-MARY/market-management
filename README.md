## Deployment


1. The frontend is available at [market-management-ashen.vercel.app](https://market-management-ashen.vercel.app/). This link hosts the React-based user interface where users can interact with the application to manage products, buy stock, and track sales.

2. The backend API is live at [market-management.onrender.com](https://market-management.onrender.com). This provides the backend services, including user authentication, product management, stock purchasing, and sales tracking. The API is built using Node.js and Express.js and communicates with a MongoDB database to store product and transaction data.

Both parts of the application are hosted separately to ensure scalability and optimize performance. You can explore the full features of the application through these URLs.
